Multifunctional silica coatings find diverse applications in solar energy conversion and pollution monitoring sensors due to their suitability for mass manufacturing. However, the challenge lies in producing robust silica coatings on a large scale with tunable refractive index. This work presents a two-step acid/base catalyzed sol–gel process for synthesizing multifunctional silica coatings with adjustable refractive index. The coatings' porous microstructure allows them to be used as double-layer broadband antireflective coatings and enhances the sensitivity of contamination sensors. The optimized double-layer coatings, designed using computer-aided techniques, demonstrate excellent broadband antireflective performance in the visible regions and high environmental durability. They achieve a maximum transmittance of 99.87% at 591 nm, with an average transmittance of 99.40% in the visible region (400–800 nm).
